# Azure VM Creation Form - Fill-in Guide

## ✅ STEP-BY-STEP: How to Fill Each Field

---

## 1️⃣ PROJECT DETAILS

### Subscription
```
✓ Keep: Azure for Students
```

### Resource Group
```
✓ Select: (New) Resource group
✓ Click: "Create new"
✓ Enter name: mean-app-rg
✓ Click: OK
```

---

## 2️⃣ INSTANCE DETAILS

### Virtual machine name
```
✓ Enter: mean-app-vm
```

### Region
```
✓ Change from: Canada Central
✓ Change to: (US) East US  OR  (US) West US 2
   (Reason: Lower latency, better for demos. Canada Central is fine too if you prefer)
✓ Keep your current: (Canada) Canada Central if that's your preference
```

### Deploy to an Azure Extended Zone
```
✓ Keep: Unchecked (leave disabled)
```

### Availability options
```
✓ Change from: Availability zone
✓ Change to: No infrastructure redundancy required
   (Reason: Cheaper, sufficient for development/testing)
```

This will remove the Zone options below it.

## 3️⃣ SECURITY & IMAGE

### Security type
```
✓ Change from: Trusted launch virtual machines
✓ Change to: Standard
   (Reason: Simpler, compatible with all features, no hibernation conflicts)
```

### Image
```
✓ Change from: Ubuntu Server 24.04 LTS
✓ Change to: Ubuntu Server 22.04 LTS - x64 Gen2
   
How to change:
1. Click "See all images"
2. Search: Ubuntu Server 22.04 LTS
3. Select: Ubuntu Server 22.04 LTS - x64 Gen2 (by Canonical)
4. Click: Select

(Reason: Better tested, more stable for production deployments)
```

### VM architecture
```
✓ Keep: x64 (selected)
```

### Run with Azure Spot discount
```
✓ Keep: Unchecked (leave disabled)
   (Reason: Spot VMs can be evicted, not reliable for production apps)
```

---

## 4️⃣ SIZE (IMPORTANT)

### Size
```
✓ Change from: Standard_D2s_v3 (US$81.03/month)
✓ Change to: Standard_B2s (US$30-35/month)

How to change:
1. Click "See all sizes"
2. In the filter, search: B2s
3. Select: Standard_B2s - 2 vcpus, 4 GiB memory
4. Click: Select

✅ Standard_B2s specifications:
   - 2 vCPUs
   - 4 GiB RAM
   - ~$30-40/month (much cheaper!)
   - Perfect for MEAN stack apps
   - Burstable performance (good for web apps)

Alternative if B2s not available:
   - Standard_B2ms (2 vCPUs, 8 GiB) - slightly more expensive
   - Standard_DS1_v2 (1 vCPU, 3.5 GiB) - minimum option
```

### Enable Hibernation
```
✓ Keep: Unchecked (will disappear after changing Security type to Standard)
```

## 5️⃣ ADMINISTRATOR ACCOUNT (CRITICAL)

### Authentication type
```

How to change:
1. Click dropdown
2. Select: "Use existing public key"
